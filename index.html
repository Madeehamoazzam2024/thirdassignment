    <section>
        Theranos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">(/ˈθɛrənoʊs/)</a> was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_technology">privately held health technology</a> corporation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-2"> <sup>[2]</sup> </a>.It was initially touted as a breakthrough <br> technology company, with claims of having devised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test">blood tests</a> that required only very small amounts of blood and could be performed <br>
        very rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false. <a href="link"><sup>[3][4][5]</sup></a> <br> Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">Elizabeth Holmes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-online-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Theranos raised more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$</a>700 million from venture capitalists and private <br> investors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-barrons-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. <a href="link"><sup>[8][9]</sup></a>
<br><br>
A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors <a href="link">John Ioannidis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Diamandis">Eleftherios Diamandis</a> , along with investigative <br> journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carreyrou">John Carreyrou</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal"><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a> , questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of <br> legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, <a href="link">the U.S. Securities</a> <a href="link">and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), <a href="link">Centers for</a> <br><a href="link"> Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. <a href="link">[10]</a> By June 2016, it <br> was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. <a href="link">[11] </a> The company was near <a href="link"> bankruptcy</a> <br> until it received, in 2017, a $100 million loan from <a href="link">Fortress Investment Group</a> secured by patents. <a href="link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
<br><br>
In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <a href="link">CLIA</a> certificate and prohibition of Holmes and <br> other company officials from owning or operating a laboratory for two years. <a href="link">[13]</a> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory <br> operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. <a href="link">[14]</a> In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a <br> settlement agreement with CMS. <a href="link">[15]</a> Following the CMS sanctions, the <a href="link">Walgreens </a> pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos <br> and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous <a href="link">breaches of contract</a> . The suit was <a href="link">settled out of court</a> , with Theranos compensating Walgreens <br> for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what <br> remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018.[16]
<br><br>
On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="link">Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani</a> were charged with "massive <a href="fraud">fraud</a> " by <br> the SEC. <a href="[12]"><sup>[12]</sup></a> One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, <br> a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000. <a href="link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with <br> Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, <br> and being barred from being an officer or director of any <a href="link">public company</a> for ten years. <a href="link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> According to the agreement, if Theranos were <br> acquired or otherwise <a href="link"> liquidated</a> , Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. <a href=link">[7]</a> Balwani did <br> not settle. <a href="link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> On June 15, 2018, the <a href="link">U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a> announced the indictment of Holmes on <a href="link">wire fraud</a> and conspiracy charges. <a href="link"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Balwani was also <br> indicted on the same charges. <a href=""></a> The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <a href="link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> but it has been delayed due to the <a href="link">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and Holmes' <br> pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021 <a href="link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. <a href="link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>

    <h3>History</h3> [<a href="link">edit</a>]
    <hr>
    While at <a href="link">Stanford University</a> , Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood. <a href="link"><sup>[25]</sup></a> She started developing <a href="link"><sup>lab-on-a-chip</sup></a> technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers. <a href="link"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Holmes dropped out of Stanford in 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words "therapy" and "diagnosis". <a href="link">[27][28]</a> The company's original name was "Real-Time Cures", <a href="link">[8][29][30]</a> which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word "cure". <a href="link"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
